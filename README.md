# FraudDetection-in-Bank-Transactions
BankSim is an agent-based simulator of bank payments based on a sample of aggregated transactional data provided by a bank in Spain. The main purpose of BankSim is the generation of synthetic data that can be used for fraud detection research. Statistical and a Social Network Analysis (SNA) of relations between merchants and customers were used to develop and calibrate the model. Our ultimate goal is for BankSim to be usable to model relevant scenarios that combine normal payments and injected known fraud signatures. The data sets generated by BankSim contain no personal information or disclosure of legal and private customer transactions. Therefore, it can be shared by academia, and others, to develop and reason about fraud detection methods. Synthetic data has the added benefit of being easier to acquire, faster and at less cost, for experimentation even for those that have access to their own data. We argue that BankSim generates data that usefully approximates the relevant aspects of the real data.
